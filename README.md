# Winter School 2025: Computational Modelling in Marine Ecology, Fisheries, and Climate

This repository contains notebooks on the different models covered during my Winter School 2025 in Ghana.

## Working in Your Own JupyterLab

Currently, there are 4 notebooks and 3 folders available to illustrate:

- **[General Overview]**: Contains notebooks pertaining to our main theme.
- **[ODE Modelling](Winter_School_Day_1_and_2.ipynb)**:  
  We introduce and apply classical models in ecology, such as the predator-prey model and the plankton ecosystem model. Before this, we provide an introduction to Python.
- **[ABM Model](IBM_model_day3.ipynb)**:  
  We introduce marine ecology and fisheries. Then, we explore agent-based models (ABM) used for complex systems, and we model the predator-prey system using the ABM approach.
- **[Drifters and Positions](Functions_MPA.py)**:  
  A fish model is implemented using the ABM approach.
- **[Drifters and Positions](Energy_Balance_Model.ipynb)**:  
  We introduce climate modelling and the greenhouse effect. First, we model the planetary temperature, and in the second part, we model catastrophic climatic events.
